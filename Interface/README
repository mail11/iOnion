DoubleLayerMostFunctional - the code that produces the best results
DoubleLayer_2Node_NoMaths - implementing the interface exactly in the way Dom did in his masters - by changing the diffusivity of the two central nodes in accordance with the series resistor model
DoubleLayer_2N_WithMaths - same as the previous one, except with additional maths considering variable D added as shown in the LaTex
